# Using Django with AWS PosgreSQL Relational Database Service (RDS)
Using [postgres hosted in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
can help reduce the workload when scaling up.

Advantages:
1. Easy to Manage
2. Security
3. Automated backups
4. High Scalability
5. Metrics
6. Monitoring
7. Amazon RDS PostgreSQL can be used with `pgvector` to perform to perform vector similarity searches

## Step 1: Prepare Your Django Application
1. Dockerize Django & PostgreSQL
2. Build `docker-compose.yml` to define services for Django App & PostgreSQL Database
3. Static and Media Files - AWS S3 is a common cloud solution

## Step 2: Create a RDS PostgreSQL Instance
1. Go to the Amazon RDS console and create a new PostgreSQL database instance.
2. Configure the database instance according to your requirements (size, version, etc.).
3. Note the database endpoint, username, and password for connecting your Django application.

## Step 4: Update Django Settings
Update your Django settings to use the RDS database credentials and any other production settings, such as using S3 for static and media files.

## Step 5: Create an ECS Cluster
1. Go to the Amazon ECS console and create a new cluster. You can choose the "EC2 Linux + Networking" configuration or "AWS Fargate" for serverless deployment.
2. Follow the wizard to configure your cluster, including VPC and security groups.

## Step 6: Create a Task Definition
1. In the ECS console, create a new task definition for your Django application.
2. Select the Docker image from the ECR repository you created.
3. Define CPU and memory requirements, environment variables (like database credentials and secret keys), and port mappings.

## Step 7: Deploy the Task Definition
1. Create a new service within your ECS cluster using the task definition you created.
2. Specify the desired number of tasks to run and configure the load balancer if you're using one.
3. Launch the service. ECS will handle the deployment of your Django application based on the configuration.

## Step 8: Configure a Load Balancer (Optional)
For production environments, you might want to configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic to your containers.
1. Create an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) in the EC2 console.
2. Configure listener rules to forward traffic to your ECS service.

## Step 9: Update Your Domainâ€™s DNS Settings (Optional)
If you have a custom domain, update your DNS settings to point to your AWS deployment, such as the ALB or the public IP of your ECS tasks.

This overview provides a pathway to deploy your Django and Postgres containers to AWS, but each step has its own set of details and considerations. AWS documentation and Django deployment best practices will be invaluable resources as you work through the process.
